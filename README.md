Eye Disease Detection is an end-to-end solution using transfer learning and Flask for classifying eye diseases from images. The project trains a VGG19 model on augmented eye image datasets and provides a responsive web interface for image upload and prediction. It detects cataract, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and normal eyes effectively.
